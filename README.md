# Robotic-Arm2
We have formulated or designed the interface. So, we created 6 engines for the robot, and each engine has a remote control consist of 5 buttons for the directions (left, right, forward, backward, off). The visual studio code was used to write the program by using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP languages). In addition, we have used the CSS language to style the HTML document. PhpMyAdmin was used to create the database. In the database, we have 6 rows and 3 columns (id, engine name, position). When the user clicks on the button then the information will be sent to the database. The engine information includes name, position and etc. After clicking on the buttons that appear on the interface, another PHP page will open showing which button the user has pressed like, if he/she pressed on the left button a PHP page will open containing the word left on the left side. The main purpose of this step is when the user press on a specific button, the position where the user has pressed on will appear on the PHP page, and after that the robot will read it and then will run.
